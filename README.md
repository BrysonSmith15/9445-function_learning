# Purpose
This repo is to allow for students to practice writing functions and seeing their outputs.
It is designed to be a game wherein the students do not look in the ./private directory, rather they simply run main.py on their functions and try to make the tests pass
# Directions
0. __*Never look in the ./private directory or any files in it*__
1. Pull the repository from github to your computer
2. Create a new branch named after you.
3. Make all three tests for all three functions pass using exploration of the test cases only by running the code
4. Test your code with py ./main.py
5. If all tests pass, you are done. Move to step 7.
6. If the tests do not pass, you should continue to modify your code. Repeat until all tests pass.
7. Commit your code and push it to github.
